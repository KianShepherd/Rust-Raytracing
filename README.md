# raytracing
A rust implimentation of Raytracing in a weekend
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

## How to use
No extra requirements to run, however it is highly recommended to compile in
release mode to speed up the program if using it for larger renders. Program
will output to a file called image.jpg in the current working directory.
